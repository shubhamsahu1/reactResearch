## Introduction to React Context API

React's Context API provides a way to share data (state, functions, etc.) across a component tree without manually passing props at every level. It is built into React and is ideal for small-to-medium applications or specific use cases (such as theming, authentication status, localization) where state needs to be shared globally.

### Under the Hood

Under the hood, `React.createContext(defaultValue)` creates a context object with a **Provider** and a **Consumer**. The `defaultValue` is used only if a component consumes the context without a matching Provider above it. A Provider sets the current context value for its subtree and subscribes all descendants that call `useContext` or `<Consumer>` to updates.

When the Provider's `value` prop changes (checked by `Object.is`), all subscribed components re-render, even if they use only part of the context. Internally, React's context uses a subscription mechanism: when a Provider updates, it notifies all its consumers, bypassing intermediate components entirely. In practice this means a deeply nested child can consume context without its parents knowing or needing to pass props.

### When to Use Context

Use Context to avoid "prop drilling" – the tedious passing of props through many layers. It shines for global-ish data that changes infrequently, like:
- UI themes
- Auth/user info
- Locale settings

By contrast, for very frequent updates or very large, complex applications, Context can lead to performance issues and may lack the strict structure of libraries like Redux.

**Rule of Thumb:**
- **React Context**: Best for simple global data in small/medium apps where performance is not critical
- **Redux (with RTK)**: Better for large apps needing strict patterns
- **Zustand**: Suits mid-to-large apps needing simplicity

In 2025, teams often use Context for things like theme, auth, or feature-isolated UI state.

## How Context Works Internally

React Context is implemented with a provider/consumer model. When you call:

```javascript
const MyContext = React.createContext(defaultValue)
```

React creates an object `{ Provider, Consumer }`. The Provider component uses the `value` prop to set the "current" context for its subtree; any component beneath it that calls `useContext(MyContext)` (or uses `<Consumer>`) will see that value.

React compares the old and new value using `Object.is`; if the reference has changed, it re-renders all consumers. This is why creating a new object literal each render (e.g. `<Provider value={{user, setUser}}>`) can cause unnecessary re-renders even if the contents are the same.

### React's Context Update Process

1. The Provider is rendered and sets the current value for its subtree
2. Each consumer (`useContext` or `<Consumer>`) subscribes to this value
3. When Provider's value changes (checked by `Object.is`), React schedules updates for all subscribed components
4. Those components re-render and get the updated value from `useContext`

Because context updates propagate by subscription, intermediate components do not need to pass props or even know about the context. For example, a Layout component can contain a deeply nested ThemeToggle that uses theme context, while Layout itself neither provides nor consumes that context. This "bypassing" is powerful but also means any context update triggers all consumers.

---

## Creating and Consuming Context

### Basic Example

Here is a simple example of creating and using a context with a provider and useContext:

```javascript
// 1. Create a Context with a default value
const UserContext = React.createContext('Guest'); // default = 'Guest'

// 2. Use a Provider to supply a context value to children
function App() {
  return (
    <UserContext.Provider value="Alice">
      <Navbar />
      <MainContent />
    </UserContext.Provider>
  );
}

// 3. Consume the context in a child using useContext
function Navbar() {
  const user = useContext(UserContext); // reads "Alice"
  return <h1>Welcome, {user}!</h1>;
}
```

In this example, `UserContext.Provider` wraps the component tree and provides the value "Alice". Inside Navbar, `useContext(UserContext)` retrieves that value. If a component called `useContext(UserContext)` without a `UserContext.Provider` above, it would get the default "Guest" value.

### Default Values

The argument to `createContext(defaultValue)` is only used when no Provider is present. In most apps this is rare, but you can rely on the default (e.g. 'Guest' above) as a fallback. Always choose a sensible default (or `null`) to avoid undefined errors if a Provider is accidentally omitted.

### Nesting and Multiple Contexts

You can create multiple contexts and nest providers. Each context is independent:

```javascript
const UserContext = React.createContext();
const ThemeContext = React.createContext();

function App() {
  return (
    <UserContext.Provider value={{name: "Alice"}}>
      <ThemeContext.Provider value="dark">
        <Layout />
      </ThemeContext.Provider>
    </UserContext.Provider>
  );
}

function Layout() {
  const { name } = useContext(UserContext); // from UserContext
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext); // from ThemeContext
  return <div data-theme={theme}>Hello {name}</div>;
}
```

This Layout component consumes both contexts via separate `useContext` calls. Note that providers can be nested arbitrarily, and a child can consume any context from any ancestor provider. In general, it's good practice to split distinct pieces of state into separate contexts (rather than one massive context). For example, use a UserContext for user data and a ThemeContext for theme data. This way a change in one context only re-renders consumers of that context.

### Context with useReducer or Custom Hooks

For complex state, you can combine Context with `useReducer` or custom hooks. For example, a ThemeProvider might hold theme state and update functions:

```javascript
function ThemeProvider({ children }) {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState('light');
  const value = useMemo(() => ({ theme, setTheme }), [theme]);
  
  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value={value}>
      {children}
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  );
}

function ThemeToggle() {
  const { theme, setTheme } = useContext(ThemeContext);
  return (
    <button onClick={() => setTheme(theme === "light" ? "dark" : "light")}>
      Current: {theme}
    </button>
  );
}
```

Here `useMemo` is used to avoid creating a new object `{ theme, setTheme }` on every render. Because Provider compares values by reference, memoizing the value means consumers only re-render when theme actually changes.

---

## Performance and Optimization

A key caveat of Context is re-renders. Whenever a context's value changes, **all consumers will re-render** (if the Provider is higher in the tree than the consumer). Even if a component only uses part of the value, it re-renders because the context object's reference changed. This makes Context ideal for mostly-read data (e.g. theme) but problematic for frequently changing global state.

For example, if you put an entire app's state (user, cart, products, etc.) in one context, any update triggers many unnecessary updates.

### Optimization Techniques

To minimize performance issues:

#### 1. Split Contexts
Use multiple contexts for different concerns or update frequencies. Instead of one big context, create `UserContext`, `CartContext`, `ThemeContext`, etc. Components then only subscribe to the contexts they need. In benchmarks, splitting a large context into smaller ones dramatically cut render times (e.g. from 350ms to 120ms for 1000 components).

#### 2. Memoize Values
Use `useMemo` or `useCallback` to ensure the object or functions passed as value stay referentially equal unless needed. For example, `{ user, updateUser }` should be wrapped in `useMemo({ user, updateUser }, [user])`. This prevents emitting a new reference each render and thus avoids extra re-renders.

#### 3. Provider Placement
Put Providers as low in the tree as possible. Rather than wrap the entire app, wrap only the subtree that needs the context. This limits how many components can re-render when the context changes.

#### 4. React.memo
Wrap consumer components in `React.memo` to avoid re-rendering them when their props (including context values) haven't changed. If a component's context value is the same as before, `React.memo` will skip re-render.

#### 5. Selective Context
For very fine-grained updates, consider libraries like `use-context-selector` or alternatives (Jotai, Redux with selectors). These allow selecting only part of the context and re-rendering only when that part changes. (React may introduce `useContextSelector` in the future.)

### Summary

Context is not a silver bullet for state management. It works best for stable, read-mostly data. Heavy state changes or large data should use more robust solutions. For instance, Redux has a diff-based store that only re-renders components using the changed slice. Zustand is another lightweight alternative with built-in subscriptions (no Provider needed) and can avoid some Context pitfalls.

## Context vs Redux vs Zustand

### React Context
- **Built-in**, no extra libraries or boilerplate
- Great for simple global values (theme, user, settings)
- Lacks middleware and rigid structure; any component can update the context value, which can make large apps harder to reason about
- Updates cause all consumers to re-render

### Redux (RTK)
- External library with a single store, reducers, and actions
- Very powerful for complex applications: supports middleware (thunks, sagas), time-travel debugging, and immutable state
- It only updates subscribed components when relevant state slices change, so it can prevent unnecessary re-renders
- However, Redux has more boilerplate and a steeper learning curve
- It's ideal for large-scale apps that need predictability and developer tools

### Zustand
- A small (≈1KB) state library with no Provider component
- Stores are global by default, but you can create multiple stores per feature
- It uses hooks to subscribe to slices of state, so only components using a particular piece of state re-render
- Zustand has an intuitive API and supports middleware/devtools, combining simplicity with performance
- In practice, teams often use Zustand for medium-to-large apps where Context's boilerplate or performance is a concern

For example, one developer reported fixing a severe performance issue simply by switching from Context to Zustand with the same amount of code – noting "the lib is <1kb. ⚛Don't use context for state".

### Decision Framework

**Choose Context for:**
- Simple, infrequent global state to reduce boilerplate (e.g. app theme or auth)

**Use Redux for:**
- Large/complex apps needing strict patterns and extensive tooling

**Use Zustand for:**
- Teams wanting simplicity without losing performance

## Testing Components That Use Context

Testing context-dependent components simply requires providing a test context value. The typical approach is to wrap the component in the appropriate Provider when rendering it in a test.

### Basic Testing Example

```javascript
import { render } from '@testing-library/react';
import MyComponent from './MyComponent';
import { MyContext } from './MyContext';

test('renders with context value', () => {
  const { getByText } = render(
    <MyContext.Provider value="dark">
      <MyComponent />
    </MyContext.Provider>
  );
  expect(getByText('The current theme is dark.')).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

Here we manually provide `<MyContext.Provider value="dark">` so that MyComponent (which calls `useContext(MyContext)`) gets the value "dark".

### Mocking Context

Another strategy is to mock the context. If you have a custom hook like `useThemeContext`, you can mock it with Jest to return a fixed value in tests:

```javascript
jest.mock('./MyContext', () => ({
  useMyContext: jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => 'dark'),
}));
```

Then rendering `<MyComponent />` without a real provider will use the mocked 'dark' value.

In all cases, make sure to test your component's behavior with a context value provided. Using React Testing Library's `render` with a matching Provider is the most straightforward and recommended approach.

## Interview Questions

### Q: How does React Context differ from prop drilling?

**A:** Prop drilling means passing props through every intermediate component just to reach a deeply nested child. It leads to bulky code and tight coupling of components. Context, by contrast, lets you skip those intermediaries entirely: a Provider makes a value available to all descendants that call `useContext`. This eliminates the need to thread props through components that don't use them. In practice, using context converts many "pass-through" props into a single shared context value. While prop drilling might be simpler in small cases, it quickly becomes unwieldy. Context provides a cleaner "publish/subscribe" mechanism for sharing data globally.

### Q: What are limitations or drawbacks of the Context API?

**A:** The biggest limitation is performance: all consumers re-render on any context update, even if they only use part of the value. This makes Context unsuitable for very dynamic or large-scale state. Context also lacks built-in structure or middleware: any component can call the update function you provided, so there's no centralized action log or middleware pipeline (unlike Redux). This can make complex updates harder to trace. Additionally, overusing Context (putting too much state in one context) leads to many unnecessary renders. Finally, Context is not designed for cross-tab or persistence; it only lives in memory. In short, Context is excellent for stable, global data, but if you need features like action history, undo/redo, or very high-frequency updates, a more specialized library may be better.

### Q: What are best practices when using React Context?

**A:** Follow these guidelines:
- Only use context for data truly shared across the app
- Avoid putting all state in one context – instead, create focused contexts (e.g. one for user data, one for UI settings)
- Memoize context values and update functions (with `useMemo`/`useCallback`) to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Keep providers low in the tree to limit re-render scope
- Provide a default value in `createContext` or Consumer to guard against missing providers
- Encapsulate context logic in a separate module or custom hook (e.g. `useAuth`) for clarity and ease of testing
- Lastly, be mindful not to use Context to avoid prop drilling "at all costs" – sometimes regular props are simpler

In summary: use context sparingly, split it by domain, memoize values, and treat it as a well-structured tool, not a catch-all state manager.

### Q: How do Context and Redux (or other state managers) compare?

**A:** Context is a basic mechanism for passing data, while Redux/Zustand/etc. are full-fledged state libraries. Redux enforces a strict unidirectional data flow and immutability, with actions and reducers. It shines in large apps: it has powerful devtools, middleware (thunks, sagas), and you can trace every state change. Redux also optimizes renders by letting you select only needed slices of state. However, Redux has boilerplate and complexity, which Context avoids.

Zustand is a minimalist library: it creates stores with hooks, no provider needed, and components subscribe to only the pieces they use. It typically requires less code and automatically skips extra renders.

In practice:
- Use **Context** for simple cases (lightweight app settings)
- Use **Redux** for complex cases (big app with many interactions and tooling needs)
- Use **Zustand** when you want something lightweight but more structure than raw Context

### Q: How can you test components that use Context?

**A:** In tests, wrap your component in the appropriate Provider with test values so that `useContext` has something to read. This is usually done with React Testing Library's `render()`. For example:

```javascript
<MyContext.Provider value={mockValue}>
  <MyComponent />
</MyContext.Provider>
```

Alternatively, you can mock context hooks: if you export a hook like `useMyContext`, use Jest's `jest.mock` to force it to return a canned value. Both approaches work, but wrapping in a real Provider is often simpler and tests integration more fully.

## Real-World Patterns

### Q: What are some real-world patterns that use Context?

**A:** Context is commonly used in the **Compound Component pattern**. For example, a `<Tabs>` component might use context to share the active tab index between `<TabList>`, `<Tab>`, and `<TabPanel>` children. The parent `<Tabs>` holds state, and children read or update it through context.

Similarly, multi-step form wizards often use a `WizardContext` to let each step component access or set form data.

Other patterns include:
- **Dropdowns/tooltips** (context shares open/close state between trigger and menu)
- **Accordions**
- **Modals** (parent controls open state, children use it)
- **Navigation/breadcrumbs**

In general, any time a parent component wants to provide data or callbacks to a flexible set of child components without prop-drilling through all levels, Context is useful.
